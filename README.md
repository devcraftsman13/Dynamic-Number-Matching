# Dynamic Number Matching Game

This is a dynamic number matching game built using **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Context API** to manage the state of the maximum number (`maxNumber`). The game allows users to select a number, and the game board will generate cards based on the selected number. The goal is to match pairs of cards with the same number.


## Features:
- User inputs a number, and the game generates matching pairs of cards.
- Cards are shuffled and displayed face-down.
- The user attempts to match pairs of cards by selecting them.
- The game shows the number of turns and allows the user to reset the game at any time.
- Animations for zooming in on hover and disappearing cards.

## Technologies Used:
- **React 18**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **React Context API**
